# Automatic-Coffee-Grinder-Doser
Getting the right coffee dose off of your grinder can be a tedious task - this Arduino sketch will let you chose from 2 - 5 different pre-set doses by the weight [g]

The project was first mentioned @ www.espressobar.dk in this thread: http://www.espressobar.dk/forums/showthread.php?9580-Mazzer-Major-DR-gt-Arduino-timer-gt-Doserless-gt-Polering&p=101197#post101197

Code is basically a danish translation and "adaptation" of the original code found here: https://www.wuala.com/Cosmicos/SoftFidelity/M%C3%BChlentimer/OledTimerWizard/?key=bh3lscgclbc5

Important: All .ino files must reside in a folder named "OLEDTimerWizard" and additional libraries must be available as per instructions in OLEDTimerWizard.ino

Documentation (HW and Menu flow diagram) can be found under "Issues" here:

Note: By "adaptation" I mean changes to my liking(!) Also, to get the smalest possible dosing variation you should maintain a constant preasure on top of your beans in the hopper. Prefarably you should replace the standard hopper with a glass or plastic tube in wich you place a metal load on top of the beans...
