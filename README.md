# Automatic-Coffee-Grinder-Doser
Getting the right dose of coffee from your grinder can be a tedious task - this Arduino sketch will let you chose from 2 - 5 different pre-set doses by the weight [g]

The project was first mentioned @ www.espressobar.dk in this thread: http://www.espressobar.dk/forums/showthread.php?9580-Mazzer-Major-DR-gt-Arduino-timer-gt-Doserless-gt-Polering&p=101197#post101197

Code is basically a danish translation and "adaptation" of the original code found here: https://www.wuala.com/Cosmicos/SoftFidelity/M%C3%BChlentimer/OledTimerWizard/?key=bh3lscgclbc5

Important: All .ino files must reside in a folder named "OLEDTimerWizard" and additional libraries must be available as per instructions in OLEDTimerWizard.ino

Documentation (HW and Menu flow diagram) can be found under "Issues" here:
https://github.com/SteffenLav/Automatic-Coffee-Grinder-Doser/issues/1

Note: By "adaptation" I mean changes to my liking(!)
